# Learn Test Automation Strategies in GHCP
## Leveraging GitHub Copilot Agent Mode for Kubernetes Deployment and Testing

---

## Abstract

Welcome to the GitHub Copilot Test Automation Lab! In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to leverage **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode** to deploy and test a microservices-based e-commerce application on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). 

This lab demonstrates how GitHub Copilot can assist with:
- Automated infrastructure setup and deployment
- Writing test scripts and validation commands
- Automated health checks and monitoring
- Troubleshooting and debugging strategies
- Creating reusable automation scripts

The application consists of 4 microservices:
- **Store-Front**: Vue.js web interface for customers
- **Order-Service**: Node.js/Fastify API for order management
- **Product-Service**: Rust/Actix API for product catalog  
- **RabbitMQ**: Message queue for async order processing

By the end of this lab, you will understand how to use GitHub Copilot to automate testing workflows and operational tasks for Kubernetes applications.
